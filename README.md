# PRAWN - RFID Scanner for Highway Regulation
A 3rd year university project using Raw Input in C++, and RFID scanners as a replacement for traffic speed cameras

Using RFID scanners and the C++ Raw Input API, the RFID scanners are used to track vehicle speed, direction, and eligibility on the roads.
Thus, replacing speed cameras inaccuracies and limited functionality for use on public roads. 

Having two applications work together with a shared database where incidents are recorded from the RFID Client program and read from the 
Observer software. The Viewer software is able to view all incident data within a grid, as well as the location of the traffic incident in the browser using the Google Maps API.
